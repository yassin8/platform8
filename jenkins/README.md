## Features
* Demonstrate how to integrate Jenkins with Gerrit.
* Demonstrate how to configure Jenkins [docker-plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Docker+Plugin) to utilise other docker images as the slave nodes.
* There's a [sample image](https://hub.docker.com/r/openfrontier/jenkins-slave/) which demonstrate how to build a jenkins-slave image for Jenkins docker-plugin.
* There's another [project](https://github.com/openfrontier/ci) which privdes sample scripts about how to combine this image with [Gerrit image](https://hub.docker.com/r/openfrontier/gerrit/) and other images to create a ci system.

## Create Jenkins container
* Please refer to the [project](https://github.com/openfrontier/jenkins-docker) shell file <createJenkins.sh>.

## Basic setup for integrating Jenkins with Gerrit.

    #A public ssh key should be imported to Gerrit first as the <Gerrit admin uid>'s public key.
    setupJenkins.sh \
      <Gerrit admin uid> \
      <Gerrit admin email> \
      <Gerrit ssh ip/name> \
      <Gerrit canonicalWebUrl> \
      <Jenkins WebUrl> \
      <Nexus public repoUrl>

    sample:
    setupJenkins.sh \
      gerrit \
      gerrit@demo.org \
      172.17.42.1 \
      http://ci.demo.org/gerrit \
      http://ci.demo.org/jenkins \
      http://ci.demo.org/nexus/content/groups/public
